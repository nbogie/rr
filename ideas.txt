Just cycle automatically through all moves in the list (say 1 per second).   On an ipad screen in big font the caller may be able to look over and see it.

Announce with audio, but only when triggered.

some prebuilt lists you can switch between:
norwegian rueda standard: lvl1, lvl2, lvl1+2...
filter for move length?
buttons for "2" "4" "6" bars length, will suggest a random move of that length.
 
display whether move is 2 bar, 4 bar, etc.
