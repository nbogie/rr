Announce with audio, a single move.

add some prebuilt lists:
norwegian rueda standard: lvl1, lvl2, lvl1+2...

filter for move length?

buttons for "2" "4" "6" bars length, will suggest a random move of that length.

allow switching between move lists

add list memory (local storage).  Why?  They can just store in a text note in another app.

display whether move is 2 bar, 4 bar, etc.

DONE:
Just cycle automatically through all moves in the list (say 1 per second).   On an ipad screen in big font the caller may be able to look over and see it.
